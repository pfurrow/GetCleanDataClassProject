## Project Description
Assembling, extracting and aggregating select statistics from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" raw data

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
The input files to this processing script are from a zip file "UCI HAR Dataset.zip" which is published on the following University of California Irving web page:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The README.TXT in the zip file explains how the data was collected and the features_info.txt explains how the metrics contained in the files were generated.

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
Some additional notes (if avaialble, otherwise you can leave this section out).

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
![alt text](HAR_file_diagram.png)

Description on how to create the tidy data file (1. download the data, ...)/

###Cleaning of the data
Short, high-level description of what the cleaning script does. [link to the readme document that describes the code in greater detail]()

##Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file
General description of the file including:
 - Dimensions of the dataset
 - Summary of the data
 - Variables present in the dataset

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)

###Variable 1 (repeat this section for all variables in the dataset)
Short description of what the variable describes.

Some information on the variable including:
 - Class of the variable
 - Unique values/levels of the variable
 - Unit of measurement (if no unit of measurement list this as well)
 - In case names follow some schema, describe how entries were constructed (for example time-body-gyroscope-z has 4 levels of descriptors. Describe these 4 levels). 

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)

####Notes on variable 1:
If available, some additional notes on the variable not covered elsewehere. If no notes are present leave this section out.
